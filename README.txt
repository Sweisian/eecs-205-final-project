Game: Black Blocky Bird
By Ryan Swei

Story:

	You are black blocky bird (no relation to flappy bird) and for some reason you decided to fly with increasing speed
	toward a forest of green pipes. Try your best to avoid them and survive as long as you can, but we all will succumb
	to the sweet embrace of death in the end.

Instructions:

	Press "space" to make black blocky bird flap his wings once. Press "P" to pause/unpause the game. Avoid the green
	pipes and survive for as long as you can. The longer you survive, the faster you fly.
